# Case Study 1 - Poor Anycast Performance

In this case study we consider a service hosted on Vultr using prefix `184.164.240.0/24`.  We anycast the prefix `184.164.240.0/24` from six Vultr PoPs in an attempt to improve performance globally: Amsterdam, Tokyo, Seattle, SÃ£o Paulo, Delhi, and Miami.

After route convergence, the service provider gets performance complaints from a Canadian ISP.  The ISP reports that IP address `204.244.0.10` is less than 5ms from Seattle, but RTTs to services hosted on `184.164.240.0/24` are much (about 220ms) higher than expected.

## Verifying the Problem

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

Let's issue pings from Seattle to the destination to verify the problem.

> To simplify things for the large number of PhD Schoo participants, you will not have access to the VMs running on Vultr.  (When using PEERING on your own, you would normally run your own instance on Vultr or elsewhere.)  Instead, we will have access to a server running on a datacenter in Texas.  The server has a somewhat complex network configuration.  To avoid further complexity on the host's network namespace, we will create containers to isolate the additional network configuration needed to run measurements.

We can use the `run-container.sh` script to launch a container using an IP address in a specified prefix:

```bash
./run-container.sh -p 184.164.240.0/24
```

> The server has an OpenVPN tunnel with each Vultr PoP.  As the server is connected to multiple Vultr PoPs (and the datacenter), we need to explicitly choose which Vultr PoP to use as egress for measurements.

We can use the `set-egress.sh` script to set the egress PoP for a given IP address.  Check the IP address inside `184.164.240/24` assigned to your container by running `ip addr`, and then configure it to egress through Seattle:

```bash
./set-egress.sh -i 184.164.240.$IP -e seattle  # change $IP to match your
                                               # container's IP
```

You can then issue measurements from your container.  Running pings
indeed show a very high RTT:

```bash
root@181b0d711bb2:/# ping 204.244.0.10
PING 204.244.0.10 (204.244.0.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 204.244.0.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=45 time=287 ms
64 bytes from 204.244.0.10: icmp_seq=2 ttl=45 time=286 ms
64 bytes from 204.244.0.10: icmp_seq=3 ttl=45 time=287 ms
```

Traceroute provides additional information:

```bash
root@181b0d711bb2:/# traceroute 204.244.0.10
traceroute to 204.244.0.10 (204.244.0.10), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

13  204.244.0.10  286.229 ms  286.083 ms  286.131 ms
```

First, the 50ms latency on the first hop comes from the OpenVPN tunnel between the server in Texas and the Vultr VM in Seattle (`137.220.39.64`).  Second, after getting to Seattle, the increase in latency from the previous hop is at most 3ms (for hops 4-12).  The destination itself, however, is 286ms away.

Although no hop other than hop 3 has a reverse DNS names, we can query the IRR for the ASNs controlling each prefix to get an idea of where the path is going:

```bash
$ whois 72.29.200.43

## Identifying the Root Cause

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

[Troubleshooting with traceroute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0RUI5kHzEQ) is tricky.  In our example, we should be mindful that the reported RTT includes the latency on both for forward and reverse paths.  For the 50ms we observe between Texas and Seattle is split 25ms each way because we know the path is symmetric over PEERING's OpenVPN tunnel.  For further hops, however, the reverse path may differ.  For example, the reverse path from hop 9 (`98.124.172.206`) back to `184.164.240.0/24` may be totally different from the reverse path from hop 10 (`64.230.125.232`) back to `184.164.240.0/24`.

With this in mind, it is safe to say that the forward and reverse paths up to hop 12 are similar, as the latency does not change significantly.  The difference in latency between hops 12 (`64.230.123.249`) and 13 (`204.244.0.10`), however, can be deconstructed into the following components:

1. The forward path latency up to hop 12
2. The forward path latency on the link between hop 12 and hop 13
3. The reverse path latency on the path from hop 13 back to `184.164.240.0/24`

We can estimate (1) at around 25ms considering that PEERING's OpenVPN tunnel alone takes about 25ms in each direction.  We can also estimate that (2) is small by probing the destination `204.244.0.10` from Seattle using a unicast (not anycast) prefix:

```bash
cunha@seattle:~$ traceroute -n 204.244.0.10
traceroute to 204.244.0.10 (204.244.0.10), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  * * *
 2  100.100.200.1  2.035 ms  2.002 ms  2.009 ms
 3  10.66.0.133  16.875 ms  16.929 ms  16.889 ms
 4  10.66.18.9  0.711 ms  1.246 ms  1.223 ms
 5  72.29.200.43  0.590 ms  0.604 ms *
 6  98.124.172.206  3.711 ms  4.000 ms *
 7  64.230.125.232  7.394 ms  6.934 ms *
 8  64.230.123.249  5.154 ms  5.128 ms *
 9  204.244.0.10  3.858 ms  3.725 ms  3.659 ms
```

Given the above, we can conjecture that the problem is on the reverse path *from the destination* to our prefix.  Without a measurement point within the destination AS however, it would be impossible to measure the reverse path if not for reverse traceroute.

We can issue a reverse traceroute from the destination to our prefix by using the `rtc.py` front-end (the tool's documentation provides more details how to use it):

```bash
$ ./rtc.py launch --vp 184.164.240.1 --remote 204.244.0.10 --label prefix240_204_244_0_10_c1
```

> Reverse traceroute measurements are grouped by labels.  It will be easiest for you to create a new label for each group of measurements you launch, as the `fetch` command will output all measurements with the label.  Reusing labels will just add new measurements to an existing group, possibly making it confusing.

The reverse traceroute takes a while to complete.  We can fetch it with the following command.  Check that the `status` of the traceroute is `COMPLETED`.

```bash
$ ./rtc.py fetch --label prefix240_204_244_0_10_c1 --print
...
$ ./rtc.py fetch --label prefix240_204_244_0_10_c1 --print

```

> Without the `--print` parameter, the `fetch` command would just print plain JSON, which you can then use to create instances of `RevTrMeasurement` and process the measurements programmatically.

The `fetch` command prints out the hops on the reverse path, the AS number controlling each prefix, the AS name, the country where the AS is registered, and the type of hop in the Reverse Traceroute measurement.  The reverse traceroute provides a strong indication of what the problem is: the route back from the Canadian ISP (AS5071) is routed towards Bharti Airtel (AS9498), an Indian network and one of the two Vultr providers in Delhi.  This is a classic example of bad anycast routes.

> This is not specific to PEERING prefixes.  Cloud operators both "groom" bad routing decisions such as these over time by contacting operators and use advanced, dynamic traffic engineering systems to bypass them.

We see that the path from the ISP back to us goes to Zayo, a major Tier-1 network.  Looking at their [Looking Glass](https://lg.zayo.com/lg.cgi) system verifies our diagnosis, as Zayo is choosing a route exported by AS9498:

```text
A V Destination        P Prf   Metric 1   Metric 2  Next hop        AS path
* ? 184.164.240.0/24   B 170        200                             9498 20473 47065 I
```

## Fixing the Issue

<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>

A brute-force approach to try and fix the problem is to not announce the prefix from Delhi.  We have made an announcement from the other five PoPs (but not Delhi) using prefix `184.164.245.0/24`.  After launching a container, setting the egress to Seattle, and running traceroute towards the destination, we find that performance is as expected:

```bash
root@c4eb822d61f7:/# traceroute 204.244.0.10
traceroute to 204.244.0.10 (204.244.0.10), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

11  64.230.79.93  53.217 ms  53.226 ms  53.139 ms
12  64.230.123.251  52.911 ms  52.873 ms  52.872 ms
13  204.244.0.10  53.064 ms  52.847 ms  52.846 ms
```

> Again, note that the 50ms on the first hop is on the PEERING-required OpenVPN tunnel between the server in Texas and the Vultr VM in Seattle.

Pulling the reverse traceroute shows that the reverse path goes straight to Seattle:

```bash
$ for i in $(seq 0 4) ; do
    ./rtc.py fetch --label tma_round1_245_$i \
        | jq -c '.revtrs[] | select( .dst == "204.244.0.10" )'
  done > out.json
$ ./rtc.py print --file out.json

  184.164.245.1 47065 (PEERING-RESEARCH-TESTBED-USC-UFMG-AS47065) US TR_TO_SRC_REV_SEGMENT
```

This brute-force approach, however, might lead to poor performance in Asia and Oceania, as we would not have a nearby PoP.  Alternatively, we can try traffic engineering techniques to induce better routing decision from the involved ASes.

One try is to set BGP communities to tune BGP's decision process in remote ASNs.  AS9498 does not seem to have publicly documented BGP communities that we could use.  AS6461 does have [publicly documented BGP communities](https://onestep.net/communities/as6461/), but setting 6461:5060 to lower AS6461's preference for routes from Delhi does not work.  Reasons include intermediate ASes removing the community from the announcement or PEERING not being a direct customer of AS6461.

Another hack we could try is to [poison AS6461][jared-bgp-curtains], artificially adding it to the announcement's AS-path to trigger BGP loop prevention and causing AS6461 to ignore the route exported from Delhi.  Unfortunately, poisoning Tier-1 ASes usually does not work as most ASes filter routes from customers that appear to traverse Tier-1s as this is usually a sign of a route leak.

[jared-bgp-curtains]: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/withdrawing-the-bgp-re-routing-curtain-understanding-the-security-impact-of-bgp-poisoning-through-real-world-measurements/

Finally, we can try using Vultr's [traffic engineering communities][vultr-bgp-communities] to ask Vultr to *not* export our prefix to AS9498 in Delhi.  This will restrict route propagation for ASes in Asia, and is a trade-off between worsening performance for ASes who would be better off using AS9498 vs improving performance for networks that are incorrectly choosing the route to AS9498.  This solution could be a temporary fix until operators are contacted to search for a more definitive solution.

[vultr-bgp-communities]: https://github.com/vultr/vultr-docs/tree/main/faq/as20473-bgp-customer-guide#action-communities

> We add files with lists of Vultr peers per site in the `resources/vultr-peers` folder.  AS numbers are in the first columns, and providers are marked with `100` on the second column.  To not export to a given provider, the community `64600:providerASN` can be used.

We make an announcement using prefix `184.164.254.0/24` containing the community `64600:9498`.  We observe the same performance improvement for the Canadian ISP as above, while still maintaining a presence in Asia by announcing to peers and the second Vultr provider in Delhi.  A forward traceroute shows low latency, and a reverse traceroute indicates the path goes straight to Seattle:

```bash
Reverse Traceroute from remote 204.244.0.10 to VP 184.164.254.1
  204.244.0.10 5071 (WESTEL-1) CA DST_REV_SEGMENT
  204.244.0.110 5071 (WESTEL-1) CA SPOOF_RR_REV_SEGMENT
  64.125.0.185 6461 (ZAYO-6461) US SPOOF_RR_REV_SEGMENT
  64.125.0.216 6461 (ZAYO-6461) US SPOOF_RR_REV_SEGMENT
  63.223.47.65 3491 (BTN-ASN) US SPOOF_RR_REV_SEGMENT

  184.164.254.1 47065 (PEERING-RESEARCH-TESTBED-USC-UFMG-AS47065) US TR_TO_SRC_REV_SEGMENT
```

Again, querying AS6461's looking glass confirms it is using a more direct route to the prefix:

```text
A V Destination        P Prf   Metric 1   Metric 2  Next hop        AS path
* ? 184.164.254.0/24   B 170        100 4294967294                  3356 20473 47065 I
```

## Verify if the Issue Persists

The measurements above were run Saturday, June 24th 2023.  We can re-run the measurements now to check if the issue persists or if routes have changed since.

## Try it Yourself

Below are some other similar cases of bad routing arising from anycast:

* A German ISP operating IP 37.251.238.254 is experiencing a similar problem to that of the Canadian ISP: Performance is very poor toward services hosted in the anycast `184.164.240.0/24` prefix.

* An ISP in the Philippines operating IP 210.213.131.117 is experiencing high delays to services running on the anycast `184.164.240.9/24` prefix.
